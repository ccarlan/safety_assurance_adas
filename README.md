# safety_assurance_adas

Repository for the models generated during the safety assurance of an ADAS system. The models are specified in FASTEN tool (to download the tool see: https://sites.google.com/site/fastenroot/features/)

The project was done by a team of four students and their supervisor within a practical course TU MÃ¼nchen named Praktikum - From Sensors to driving functions - develop your own car in the sommer semester of 2020.

The students executed assurance activities in order to ensure the safe operation of three ADAS systems (e.g., lane keeping assistent, adaptive cruise control and emergency break), while following the safety lifecycle recommended by the ISO 26262 standard for functional safety of automotive electrical and/or electronic systems. 

Output engineering models:

- Losses and Hazards List Models;
- STPA Outputs Models;
- Requirements Models;
- System Architecture Models;
- Safety Case Models.
