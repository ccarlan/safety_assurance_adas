# safety_assurance_adas

Repository for the models generated during the safety assurance of an ADAS system. The models are specified in FASTEN tool (to download the tool see: https://sites.google.com/site/fastenroot/features/)

The project is done by a team of four students and their supervisor within a practical course TU MÃ¼nchen named 	
Praktikum - From Sensors to driving functions - develop your own car in the sommer semester of 2020.

The description of the practical course:

In this practical course, you will be part of a team to develop an autonomous platooning functionality for cars. Platooning is an autonomous driving function that enables cars or trucks to drive behind one another at a very close distance such that fuel can be saved. This scenario not only requires correct and efficient strategies for the management of the platoon, but also a sound safety concept that ensures the dependable operation of the cars also in the event of hardware faults (e.g., sensors).

There will be two teams within the course. The function development team will develop the platooning functionality by extending existing components (e.g., adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assistance, car-to-car communication). The team will address different roles (e.g., leader and follower car) and functions (e.g., a car joining or leaving a platoon, joining two platoons into one, or splitting a larger platoon) comprised by platooning. The safety team will execute assurance activities in order to ensure the safe operation of a part of the system (e.g., adaptive cruise control). It will analyze different fault mitigation measures (i.e., safe state and fail-operational degraded behavior), and integrate them into the actual implementation of the system, while following the safety lifecycle recommended by the ISO 26262 standard for functional safety of automotive electrical and/or electronic systems. Furthermore, the students will model the safety case of the subsystem. A safety case is an argumentation that a system is safe to operate in a given context, based on evidence generated during the system development.

The participants will apply a model-based approach in order to develop the safe platooning functionality and the safety assurance argumentation. The two teams will manage themselves and need to coordinate in order to come up with a joint solution that will be deployed and evaluated on professional remote-controlled car models (scale 1:10).
